# Emissario

*University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign  
Database Systems (CS411) Fall 2015 Final Project*  

### Summary
Emissario will help connect students who need to send a package to a family member or buy something from their hometown with another student who has travel plan to the same destination.

### Background
The idea for our project came from how often we saw situations similar to the examples below:
*	A is traveling back to his hometown for the holidays. B, who is also from the same hometown and friends with A, wants to give a cell phone to his father back at the home country. Then B asks A if he can help bring the iPhone back home and pass it to his father.
*	X has been wanting to get some cosmetic items which are only available in Japan. She finds out that Y is going on a trip to Japan soon, so she asks Y to help buy the items and bring them back for her.
  
These types of exchange are very common among us â€“ international students. Shipping via the post office or private courier services costs a lot of money, so when we find out that someone is travelling to the same destination, we will ask if they can help us with our requests.  
  
The problem is, currently there is no easy way to figure out who is going to be travelling to the destination we are looking for. Among so many friends we have, generally we only know the travel plan of our closest friends. Often times when we are looking for help, we are too late and only find out after the person has left the town.  
  
Our team developed Emissario with the circumstances above in mind. We wanted to create a bridge where people can post their requests, find out who might be able to help, and connect to these travelers easily. This way we can help people to cut down the time and effort spent on locating someone who may be able to help with their needs.
